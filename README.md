Feature Selection based Genetic Algorithm for Storm Surge

This package contains algorithms published in the paper "Automatic Feature Selection for Storm Surge Forecasting". Set of six common regression learning methods including SVM (Support Vector Machine), kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), (RF) Random Forest (RF), MLP (Multi-layer perception), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and GBR (Gradient Boosting Regressor) used for wrapper-based feature subset selection by using Genetic Algorithm. They are implemented by python using scikit-learn package and zoofs library.
